# ScienzaBot
This bot was made to tag the people when in a group where a lot of topics are treated.  
The bot look in every message for a "**list**".  
A **list** is basically a topic.  
The bot supports multiple lists.  
A list is called via a special character prepending the name of the list (`@`, `#`, `.` or `!`).  
When a list is called, the bot contacts via private message all the users **subscribed** to the list.  
A **subscription** is the relationship a user creates when he __joins__ a list.
If the group where the list was called is private, the bot will just say that a list was **invoked**, providing the possibility to see the message by tapping on a inline keyboard button to be tagged at the message:

If instead the group is public, the bot will also provide 2 additional buttons; One that takes the user to the group, and the other one the the message in the group:

The user also provide the possibility too "bookmark" a message.
Basically the message get saved and a user can see it later in time.

[To be completed in the future]
